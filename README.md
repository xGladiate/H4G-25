# H4G-25

Below are the rough layout for our web application

## 1. Login Screen
- Both Resident and Admin are able to log in from the same login screen
- Forget Password works for both Resident and Admin, where an email would be sent to their respective registered email
- Based on the username entered, the system would determine whether the users are residents or admin
- Users would be directed to their homepage (Resident Homepage or Admin Homepage) accordingly 

## 2. Resident Screen
 - There will be 3 tabs in the resident screen: `Earn`, `Buy`, `Account`
 - Earn: This page would consist of the task details
 - Buy: This page would consist of the shop with products name, details and associated vouchers required to purchase that product
 - Account: This page would consist of the `Currently accepted task`, `Voucher Balance` and  `Transaction History`

## 3. Admin Screen
 - There will be 4 tabs in the resident screen: `Inventory`, `Voucher Balance`, `Product Collection` and `Account Balance`

## Future Consideration
 - Admins would be able to manage accounts, such as adding accounts and suspending accounts
 - Residents would be able to reset their password in the case when they forgot their password
